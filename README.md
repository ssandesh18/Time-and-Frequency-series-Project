Earth electromagnetic data were collected. Earth X, Y & Z time series data were cleaned and process by using various statistical method.
Origin, MATLAB and Fortan software were used for data analysis. Time data converted into frequency domain data by using Fourier transform.
Fourier transform anomaly map of earth conductivity was developed.
